# Experiments

These are my various first tries at doing things in different programming
langauges. Whenever I try to learn something new, I check in the initial
code snippets and experiments here.

I stole the idea for this repo from Jeff Hammond's
[HPCInfo](https://github.com/jeffhammond/HPCInfo) repository.

Nothing here is production quality.  It's just what I needed to write to
see how things work.
